# A Complete kitchen Renovation in Ilford

![Kitchen remodelation 1]({kitchen1})

The kitchen was a mess. The cabinets were old and outdated, the appliances were outdated, and the
flooring was stained and cracked. The homeowners were tired of looking at it, and they knew it was
time for a change. They contacted "**WeWork4U**", and together they created a plan. The
first step was to remove the old cabinets and appliances. Once the old items were gone, the company
installed new cabinets, appliances, and flooring. They also added a new backsplash and some new
lighting. The renovation took a few weeks, but when it was finished, the kitchen was transformed.
The new cabinets were a beautiful white color, the appliances were stainless steel, and the flooring
was brand new.
